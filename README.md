# KnowYourData – Data privacy game for kids
## Inspiration
We were inspired by the fact that one-third of global internet users are under the age of 18. Most of them use the internet under no supervision of adult and don't have proper education about data privacy. For that reason, we decided that we should contribute to educating children of good data privacy practices to inform the youth of a safer way to navigate the internet. With this project, we aim to tackle the lack of data privacy education. 

## What it does
The website has the player go through a series of scenarios where different approaches to daily tasks like downloading a game, choosing a password, setting up a profile, etc. are tested. With each correct or incorrect answer, the website display informative feedbacks on how the task should be done to ensure data privacy. The gameplay is simple for kids from the age of 6-10 to understand. 

## How we built it
We brainstormed together, conducted user interviews to figure out features, created sitemaps and feature ideas then divided into three groups: Front-End, Back-End, and Design to finish the project. 

## Challenges we ran into
It take a long time for us to come up with an idea as each of us prefers to do a different thing. We also spent a lot of time learning the technologies, which delay the start of the actual coding of the project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of a functionally working game and the fact that we've learned a lot of new technologies in this project. We've also learned how to do a project from scratch with steps from user experience research to finished running product.

## What we learned
New technologies, teamwork, and the fun of building a project!

## What's next for KnowYourData – Data privacy for kids
Improved UI and expand the game to multiple storylines
