		<p> We were inspired by the fact that one-third of global internet users are under the age of 18. Most of them use the internet under no supervision of adult and don't have proper education about data privacy. For that reason, we decided that we should contribute to educating children of good data privacy practices to inform the youth of a safer way to navigate the internet. With this project, we aim to tackle the lack of data privacy education. </p>

        <p> The website has the player go through a series of scenarios where different approaches to daily tasks like downloading a game, choosing a password, setting up a profile, etc. are tested. With each correct or incorrect answer, the website display informative feedbacks on how the task should be done to ensure data privacy. The gameplay is simple for kids from the age of 6-10 to understand. </p>
